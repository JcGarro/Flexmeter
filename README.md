(This project is done for the fullfilment of our course Electives 4 (Instrumental Devices))


This is an electronic instrumental device that measures the change in the circumference of the arm due to the contraction of the muscle which is meant to replace the existing analog type of this device.

 The device is made up of the following:
 - Microcontroler
 - Cloth made up of copper for conduction purposes
 - Foam like material for the body 
 - Circular spring for the mechanism, responsible for the contraction of the device
 - LCD , which is reposible for displaying the output
